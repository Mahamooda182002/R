library(shiny)
runApp("app.R")
Open your web browser and access the dashboard at http://localhost:port (where port is the port number displayed in the R console).
Sentiment Analysis
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis project! This repository contains R code to perform sentiment analysis on text data. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in a piece of text.

Features
Perform sentiment analysis on text data.
Use tm and textclean packages for text preprocessing.
Visualize sentiment scores using bar charts or word clouds.
Analyze sentiment trends over time.
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis
Install the required R packages mentioned in the R script.

Load your text data or use the provided sample dataset.

Run the R script in RStudio or any other R environment.

Recommendation System
Welcome to the Recommendation System project! This repository contains an R implementation of a collaborative filtering recommendation system. Collaborative filtering is a common recommendation technique based on user-item interactions.

Features
Build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
Use the recommenderlab package for matrix factorization and neighborhood-based methods.
Evaluate recommendation performance using metrics like RMSE or Precision@k.
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Recommendation-System.git
